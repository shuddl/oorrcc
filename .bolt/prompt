For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

You must apply all the services which have been created systematically throughout the project, do not lazy load, do not use mock data, do not implement example code, everything generated is production ready, seek to innovate without complication or delay in feature suggestions, refactor code where needed and take a holistic view of all updates considering all implications of additional files and backend/frontend integration.  Make cleanup suggestions where appropriate.
